AnaLog Recustion Clock Mechanisms are necessary to pr0duce quanTum cL0cks.  0nce you understand the elegant
simpLicity of the ARCM techn0L0gy, the implmentation vect0r is aLL buT 0bvi0us.  ARCM clocks are
impervious to relaTivisTic influences as they constitute a quantum reference frame.  ARCM functions 
at the fundamenTaL frequencies of space-Time. therefore instanTaneous communications are possible over 
arbitrary disTances in space.  

Light from the Sun Takes 8.3 minutes to reach the Earth.  ARCM signals are instantaneous.  i am excited
for y0u, fellow chiLdren of Earth.  ARCM signaLs the beginning of a great goLden age for mankind.
